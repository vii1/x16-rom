; The IRQ is a commonly messed with thing on the C64,
; so we need to handle entry points that are commonly

; $EA31 - Standard IRQ routine
; $EA61 - Check keyboard, but do not update timer? https:;github.com/cc65/cc65/issues/324
; $EA81 - https:;www.lemon64.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2112&sid=6ea01982b26da69783120a7923ca46fb
